TextShare
=========
An online open-source shared text editor that runs on Node.js and Socket.io and uses JQuery. 
It is currently under development, future implementation will redesign the web pages, UI as well as add a lot of features.
The current implementation is just a test design and a way for me to learn more about Socket.io.
